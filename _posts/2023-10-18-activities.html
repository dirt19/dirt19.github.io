<h2>What else have I been doing whilst searching for employment?</h2>
<h3>My usual daily schedule is currently:</h3>
    <ul>
	    <li>6am : morning reading, skim news for current events</li>
	    <li>8am - 9am : Review any recruiter correspondence that came in</li>
	    <li>9am - 12pm : Review job postings (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed, company-of-interest careers site)</li>
	    <li>12pm - 1pm : lunch, walk</li>
	    <li>1pm - 3pm : Skills Development and Review</li>
	    <li>3pm - 4pm : Review any additional correspondence that may have come in (emails, LinkedIn messages, etc.)</li>
	    <li>4pm - 5pm : Wrap up, check calendar for any planned interviews, phone screens, or other activities and events</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Other Activities</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Volunteering to do Flag posting with local groups on National
	holidays (e.g. Labor Day). We post flags after sunrise (per US Flag
	Code) and retrieve shortly before sun down.</p>
	<li><p>Watching refresher lectures on YouTube</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>FPGAs and intro projects (high-frequency trading)</p>
		<li><p>Digital Signal Processing (some math, not just deep-fake
		voice-over projects)</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Helping neighbors with home maintenance tasks (e.g.
	winterizing sprinkler systems)</p>
	<li><p>Using Python to retrieve, represent, and make simple stock
	trade decisions (algorithmic trading)</p>
	<li><p>Delete and rebuild my WSL Ubuntu environment</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Trying to get Docker to work properly again</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Construct spreadsheets for my wife’s embroidery hobby which
	is turning into a small business venture</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Cost Analysis: to figure out what we might actually need to
		make in order to make this a viable business</p>
		<li><p>Pricing: to have a baseline, some consistency, and to have a
		reason behind the number – not just gut feel</p>
		<li><p>Pattern consistency and statistics: how big was that
		project, what materials did I use, where did we source them from,
		how long did it take</p>
		<li><p>Product catalog / project portfolio</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
